"""core/verify/lesion_registry.py

The system-wide protocol for "turn this faculty off and see".

:mod:`core.verify.causal_influence` can only reach a verdict about a channel if
somebody hands it paired trials, and the pairs only exist if the faculty can be
neutralized on demand. One engine in this codebase already worked that way —
``AffectiveValenceEngine.lesion()`` returns a flat neutral affect so its
contribution is fully ablatable. Everything else claiming causal influence
claimed it without offering any way to check.

This is that capability generalized. A faculty registers how to make itself
neutral; the registry hands the harness a uniform way to do it, so measurement
does not need to know anything about the subsystem it is measuring.

Neutral is not broken. A lesioned faculty must return its no-information
output — a flat affect, an identity transform, an empty context block, alpha
zero — and must not raise, hang, or degrade the run into an error path. A
lesion that crashes the turn measures the crash, not the faculty.

Layering: registration is inverted. Faculties import this; this imports no
faculty. See DEPS.

#: A probe measuring the live runtime lesions a channel and generates. If that
#: flag were process-global, any user turn generating concurrently would be
#: served by the lesioned faculty — the measurement would degrade the very
#: system it is measuring, silently, for a real person mid-conversation.
#:
#: asyncio tasks inherit a copy of the context at creation and their mutations
#: never propagate back, so a lesion set inside a probe task covers that task
#: and everything it awaits, and is invisible to any turn running beside it.
#: ``asyncio.to_thread`` copies the context too. Where generation crosses into
#: a separate worker process, the lesion has already done its work: the values
#: are neutralized while the request is being assembled, and the request
#: carries them.
