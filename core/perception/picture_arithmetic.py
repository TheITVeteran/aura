"""The few things done to a picture to see what moves in it, without OpenCV.

Her primary process on macOS refuses OpenCV (core/media/safe_imports.py): its
AVFoundation stack collides with the one speech-to-text loads. LIVE 2026-10-04,
asked to mend and play a broken Pong, the repair failed on its first picture
with "OpenCV import is blocked", though every offline run had passed, because
the offline runs never installed the guard. What following things in a picture
needs from a vision library is small: decode a screenshot, shrink it, make it
grey, compare two, grow a mask by a pixel, find its connected pieces, and a
median filter once per screen. numpy, scipy and Pillow do all of it in the
same process the person is talking to.

The results have OpenCV's shapes (the stats rows of connected pieces are
x, y, w, h, area; label 0 is the background), so callers read them the same.
