"""Looking closer at writing that did not read as words: its place read again by itself, larger.

Lettering drawn for a game (outlined, shadowed, set over a busy picture) comes
back from a reading of the whole screen with its letters half right. LIVE
2026-10-09 a title's START was read "sitarit", and she never saw the way on
that a person reads at a glance; read again from its own place, cut out and
enlarged, it was "Start". A person who cannot make out a word looks closer at
it, and so does she: a short piece of writing that is not words of the language
is read again by itself, and where that reading is words, it is what the place
says.

Only short pieces (a label, not a paragraph) and only a few a look, since each
is a reading of its own; and what a piece came to is remembered by how it
looked, so a screen that stays up is not read closer again on every look.
