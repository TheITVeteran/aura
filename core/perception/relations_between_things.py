"""Relations between things on a screen, said in words and checked by measurement.

A step's end is often a relation between two things: "the roller sits at the end of the arrow", "the cage drops on
Jerry", "the box is under the ledge". Whether it holds is not in the screen's words, which never say it; it is in
where the two things are. Robots that follow instructions check the same way: the language names the things and the
relation, and the relation is measured on where perception found them (VoxPoser and ReKep, 2023 and 2024, write a
task's ends as constraints between named parts; Inner Monologue held each step to what the scene then showed).

Here a sentence is read for two things and the relation between them, each thing found on the screen by its name
(the words a region shows or her eyes named it by), and the relation measured on their boxes. Where the sentence names
no relation, or either thing cannot be found, nothing is measured: that is not a relation shown not to hold.
