"""Watching a surface as one continuous stream, with her own acts on the same timeline.

Looking at a still picture, acting, and looking at another is how a board is
played, and it misses everything in between: a scene that plays out on its
own, a line that appears and is gone, an answer that came and went before the
second picture. LIVE-like 2026-10-05 an archived game opened on a scene of
speech bubbles appearing one after another; read one still at a time, every
bubble looked like a button, she clicked each in turn, and each click seemed to
work, because the scene went on by itself.

A person watches. What changes while they do nothing is the thing going on by
itself; what changes just after they act, where it was not already changing, is
the answer to what they did; and while a scene is playing they wait for it.
Here the surface's frames are sampled continuously, a few times a second, into
a timeline of how much changed and where; her acts are put on it as she makes
them; and from the two:

- ``answered``: whether an act was answered, beyond what the surface was doing anyway;
- ``playing_on_its_own``: whether something is going on by itself now (a scene, an animation that ends);
- ``keeps_changing_on_its_own``: the parts of the picture that keep changing while she does nothing,
  such as a scene's lines, which are read and not pressed;
- ``watch``: waiting while it plays, as long as it plays, up to a bound.

A part that changes all the time (a spinning coin, a ticking clock) is part of
the picture, not something going on: it is left out of all of these. Nothing
here knows what a game, a scene or a button is.
