"""A world as its code makes it: how her body is moved and kept in, the ground to be gone over, what each kind of
thing does to her, the clock and the lives, in the stage's own pixels and seconds.

A person handed a game's source and asked how it plays reads it for its physics before anything else: the hero runs
150 pixels a second while an arrow is held and is kept between the top bar and the floor; the floor is cut into
20-pixel squares from y = 40, and a square is painted when the middle of the hero is over it; 85% of them painted wins.
Played without that, every one of those numbers has to be found by trying and watching, and some of them (where the
squares begin, which part of her paints) are not shown by anything she can see until she has gone wrong over them.

This is what such a reading comes to, as data: what a reader of the code finds
(core/perception/reading_a_world_s_code.py for a page's scripts; core/perception/how_a_program_plays.py for a Flash
program) and what her play takes from it (core/agency/ground_her_code_names.py). Nothing here is run from the program,
and nothing names a game.
