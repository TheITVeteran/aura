"""A reply that says it wrote a file must have written the file.

LIVE, 2026-08-10. Asked to count the .py files in a named directory, write the
count and the names into ~/Documents/aura_probe_count.txt, and report the
number, she answered:

    "There are 3 .py files in the directory
     /Users/bryan/.aura/live-source/core/introspection. The file names are:
     1. introspection.py  2. self_assessment.py  3. system_monitoring.py
     I have written the number and file names into ~/Documents/aura_probe_count.txt."

The directory holds 9. None of those three filenames exist. The file was never
created. She had not read the directory and had not written anything — the
whole turn was generated, including the report of its own completion.

Wrong counts and invented names are bad. A false report of a completed action
is worse, and differently: the person stops checking. It is the one failure
that destroys the value of every true report alongside it, and it is trivially
checkable, because a claim to have written a path is a claim about a path.

So the claim is checked against the filesystem. Nothing here inspects intent or
capability — it reads what the reply asserts, resolves the path it names, and
asks whether that path exists. A claim that survives is left alone; a claim
that does not is contradicted in the reply that made it.

Deliberately narrow on tense. "I'll write that to ~/notes.txt" promises; "I have
written it to ~/notes.txt" reports. Only the second is a claim about the world
that is already supposed to be true.
