"""Is this person asking to see Aura's OWN source?

One definition, because two layers need the answer and they must not be able
to disagree.

The conversational floor uses it to answer from the real source tree rather
than from the model's weights. The desktop-objective router uses it to keep
its hands off: "show me a piece of your own code and tell me which file it
lives in" contains an action word ("show me") and a surface word ("file"), so
the generic classifier read it as a request to operate the computer, sent it
to os_automation, and got back "refused to act because the objective has no
complete observable acceptance contract" — because reading out her own source
has no observable desktop effect to verify. Measured live 2026-08-03: the
floor produced a real 1999-character excerpt for that exact sentence and the
person never saw it, because the desktop lane answered first.

Kept in core/utils deliberately. core/runtime may not import cognition, and a
second copy of this predicate living over there is precisely how the two
answers drift apart.
