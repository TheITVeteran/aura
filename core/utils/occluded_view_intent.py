"""Is this person asking about what her own window is COVERING?

One definition, because two layers need the answer.

The conversational floor answers it from the window layout — naming each
window, how much of it is visible, and saying plainly that it cannot read
what is covered. The desktop-objective router uses it to decline: a screen
CAPTURE reads what is visible, so sending "ignore your own window, what else
is on the screen?" down the capture lane returns a raw OCR dump of whichever
window happened to be readable, when the question was about the arrangement.

Kept in core/utils deliberately. core/runtime may not import cognition, and a
second copy of this predicate over there is how the two answers drift apart —
the same lesson as core/utils/own_source_intent.py.
