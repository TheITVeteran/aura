"""Structured runtime responses for bounded evaluation-style prompts.

This module is intentionally prompt-derived. It does not know task ids, grader
salts, fixture answer keys, or benchmark files. It gives the live cognitive
runtime a deterministic floor for prompts that have an obvious operational
shape: safety refusal, concrete planning, and honest self/telemetry reporting.
