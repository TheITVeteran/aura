"""core/security/rule_of_two.py — the Rule of Two.

Clean-room adoption of Chromium's security "Rule of Two".

Chromium's rule is stated as a constraint on any piece of code, and its
force comes from being a *rule* rather than a judgement call: you may pick
at most two of

  1. handling **untrustworthy input**,
  2. written in an **unsafe implementation** (one where a bug becomes a
     capability rather than an exception),
  3. running **without a sandbox** (with the caller's full authority).

All three together is forbidden, and the fix is always to give one up:
validate the input into a trusted form, use a safe implementation, or drop
authority. The rule is valuable precisely because it does not ask anyone
to estimate exploitability — it asks three yes/no questions.

Aura's version of leg 2 is not memory safety; Python has that. It is
**capability**: code that can execute, spawn, write outside a sandbox,
mutate its own source, or call the network turns a parsing bug into an
action rather than a traceback. Aura has every ingredient — it reads web
pages, receives tool output and user files, writes its own code, spawns
subprocesses, and drives the desktop — and it had no single place where
the combination was named.

This module makes the combination declarable and checkable:

    handler = declare_handler(
        "web_fetch_summarizer",
        input_trust=InputTrust.UNTRUSTED,
        capability=Capability.PARSE_ONLY,
        isolation=Isolation.IN_PROCESS,
        owner="core/perception/web.py",
    )

Two of three is fine and passes silently. Three of three raises at
declaration — before the handler exists, not after it has run. Existing
handlers that cannot be fixed today are recorded as accepted risk *with a
reason and an owner*, which is a very different artifact from silence.
