"""Where a click is a shot and the pointer aims it, and nothing in the place is her own body: what the shot goes at,
and when she gets out of the way.

Some places put a player nowhere in the picture. She stands this side of it, and what she does goes into it: a
food fight seen over a table, a gallery of targets, a snowball thrown at whoever shows. A person told "take aim with
your mouse and click to throw" does not look for herself there. She throws at whoever has just shown, since they
will not be up for long; failing that, at the biggest thing going across. And where the words give her a key for
getting out of the way, she presses it when something comes at her, which in such a place means it grows.

Nothing here knows a game. A thing is whatever her eyes follow in the picture (core/perception/what_moves_in_the_picture.py).
