"""How hard and which way: an act whose strength and direction she sets, learned from where what it sends goes.

Some things are not steered but sent. A golf ball is struck once, a ball is
tossed at a hoop, a top is let go into a ring, a stone is pulled back on a
sling: the act is a pull and a letting go, or a press held and let go, and all
of it is in how far, which way and how long. Nobody knows the right pull for a
putt before trying one. They try, see where the ball stops, and pull a little
more or less, a little left or right, and after a few they have the measure of
it.

So does she. A setting is a few numbers: the pull across and down, as shares
of the picture, and how long the press is held. A shot is a setting tried and
what came of it: where what it sent ended up, and whether anything counted
went up. From the shots so far she fits how a change in the setting moves
where the thing ends up, near the settings tried (a linear model by least
squares, which with two numbers and two shots is the secant method), and
solves it for the place she wants the thing to go. Where there is no place to
aim at, only a count that went up or did not, she searches the settings the
way the cross-entropy method does (Rubinstein, 1999): settings drawn around the
best so far, the spread narrowing round those that paid.

Nothing here knows what is being sent, or what a game is. A slider dragged to
a value, a page flung to a place, a window thrown to a corner are settings
found the same way: an act with a measure, and a result to hold it against.
