"""The situations she knows: what a place puts her in, how she can tell, and what that sets her play to.

Games put players in the same few situations again and again, and so do programs
and sites. Things fall and are to be caught, or dodged. Something is to be kept
away from whoever is after it until help comes. A thing is tossed to whoever is
there to take it. Everything of a kind is to be collected before the clock runs
out. A press is made when two things line up. What was shown is done again.
Something is made, and nothing is won. A person knows each at once and plays it
the way it asks before any of its things has touched them: they get under what
is to be caught, keep wide of what is coming at them, and know that the clock
running out while they hold on is the win, not the loss.

Each situation here is said for anywhere (none names a game, a character or a
site) as what play needs of it, not as advice to read. It is known by its
words, on a floor of phrasings and a learned surface over them
(core/language/learned_matcher.py) that decides the phrasings the floor misses
and abstains otherwise. What it sets is used directly by her play
(core/agency/playing_as_it_happens.py, core/agency/the_way_it_is_played.py):

* the ways it is played (core/agency/ways_of_playing.py), offered after any the
  place's own words name;
* what she supposes of a thing of a kind not yet met, by how it moves: what
  falls is to be caught or kept clear of, what heads for her kept clear of or
  shot at, until meeting it says otherwise;
* how wide she keeps of what costs her;
* whether lasting is the task, and what the clock running out means.

Each situation's structure follows the description of a game the general
video game playing work settled on (an avatar, the roles of the things, what
meeting each does, what ends it: VGDL, Schaul 2013; Perez-Liebana et al.,
GVGAI). ``elsewhere`` says where the same situation stands outside games.
