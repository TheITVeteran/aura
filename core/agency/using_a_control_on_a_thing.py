"""A control used on the thing it is for, when she is beside it: told "Press SPACE to open doors", she presses space
when she comes up beside a door.

A game's words often name what a key does and what it is done to: open doors, climb ladders, talk to people, pick
up items. The guide to the place keeps each control with its act and the thing it is done to (``Control.on``,
core/cognition/a_guide_to_a_place.py), and her eyes name the things in the picture (``WhatSheSees``,
core/cognition/what_things_are.py). A person who has read the controls and comes up beside a door presses the key
that opens doors. If they walked past it, they would never learn what was behind it. The people in the recordings
of these games did just that: they stopped at each door and pressed the key, talked to everyone they met, and
climbed every ladder they reached.

What a thing is for may be known even when the game does not say what the key is done to. Told "press up to climb",
a person knows a ladder is a thing you climb. Her knowledge of such things anywhere (what a kind of thing usually is)
joins the two. A name for many things ("people", "items", "enemies") is matched by how a thing bears, as she knows
it: a character, a thing to get, a danger.

What followed a press made at a thing decides what she keeps. If the thing went away, moved or changed, or
something new came near it, or the screen changed, the press did something. She says so, and uses that key on that
kind wherever she meets it. If nothing changed after two presses at one kind of thing, she stops using that key on
that kind. Clicks go to the thing itself, wherever it is. Keys are pressed only beside it, the way the game's words
say.

And what a press did once is not news the third time. A closet opened, shut, and opened again shows what it showed;
a person who has looked in it goes to look somewhere else. So what the screen looked like after each use of a control
on a thing is kept, coarsely, and a use that brings back only what that use has brought before is doing nothing new:
after two such, that thing is left for others, until something about it changes. LIVE 2026-10-13 she stood in a
game's kitchen opening a closet and looking at what was in it, again and again, with the way out of the room in sight.

Nothing here knows a game.
