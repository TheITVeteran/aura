"""What a place's code says of the things she sees: which is her, what each costs her or is worth, and how it goes.

Her eyes give her kinds of things by their look (a colour, a size); a reading of the place's code
(core/perception/reading_a_world_s_code.py) gives her its things by what it keeps them as and what it fills each in. A
kind she sees in the colour the code fills a thing of its own with is that thing: the code draws her body in #f2f2f2
and its bugs in #2a9a2a, and its bugs cost a life when they touch her. So before a bug has touched her she keeps clear
of it; before her keys have been tried, the white square is taken for her, until her trials say otherwise; and what the
code says of how fast a kind wanders is how far it could swerve (core/agency/how_far_a_thing_could_swerve.py).

A colour two of the code's things share tells neither apart (two paddles drawn alike), and is left to play to say.
Offline 2026-10-13, put to the paint world in its own code with her whole live play, she pressed keys for half a
minute before taking the white square for hers and went to meet a bug before learning it cost her.
