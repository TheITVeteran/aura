"""The ground a place's code says is to be gone over, as it lies in her picture: which cells there are, which of them
she has marked, and which are left.

Without the code she measures ground in cells of her own size over the whole picture. That is wrong in two ways a
reading of the code puts right. The code's cells are its own size and begin where it says, so her cells and its
cells disagree about what is done. And the picture holds more than the ground: offline 2026-10-13 a painter whose
floor began 40 pixels below the top of its picture, under its score bar, went to the "ground" beside the bar, held
the up arrow against the top of the floor for eighteen seconds, and painted nothing more. With the code's grid
(core/perception/a_world_as_its_code_makes_it.py) only its cells are ground, a cell is marked when the point of her
the code marks by is over it, and what is left is exactly what the code still counts as not done.

Nothing here names a game: a grid, a point of her body and a rectangle she is kept in, from whatever code said them.
