One authority for the question: "may this text become a STANDING objective?"

A standing objective is durable volitional state — it survives the turn that
produced it, gets promoted into initiatives and goals, drives the executive
closure's imperative display, and re-enters cognition at every restore. Live
evidence (July 2026) shows three text classes repeatedly leaking into that
role and resurrecting themselves through the persistence loop:

1. **Ephemeral conversation turns** — "Ok. Once more. You with me?" spent
   weeks as CURRENT IMPERATIVE at urgency 0.98 because a check-in question
   was bound as current_objective and every downstream organ trusted it.
2. **Control-contract scaffolds** — "[EMBODIED CONTROL CONTRACT] ..." prompt
   frames from the embodied NetHack lane persisted as active goals.
3. **Non-linguistic renders** — raw dungeon-map framebuffers became the
   committed executive objective (origin `embodied_motor_reflex`), which no
   chat-turn classifier can catch because they are not language at all.

Quarantine-after-the-fact proved insufficient: the executive loop recreated
the goal faster than provenance repair abandoned it. The durable fix is to
refuse these texts at EVERY ingress into standing state — selection,
proposal, arbitration, restore, and store repair — via this one predicate.
