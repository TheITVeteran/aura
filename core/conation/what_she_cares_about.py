"""What she cares about: what she gives her own turns to, and whose fate reaches her.

Bryan, 13 October 2026: "We need to give Aura the ability to care. Not just
'Care for' but intrinsically care about. Genuine interest that matters to her
and whatever branches/connects to that."

Liking was already hers (core/conation/what_she_wants.py): what the turns a
thing was in were worth to her. Caring is another relation to the same thing.
A person can like a song and not mind what becomes of it. On the accounts
that try to say what caring is, three things mark it, and each is kept here
as a count of something that happened:

    she gives herself to it     Of her own accord, when nobody brought it:
                                she raises it, she picks it when she is
                                free, she goes back. Interest that is a
                                person's own and not the situation's shows
                                as coming back without being led (Hidi and
                                Renninger 2006), and a thing becomes one's
                                own by acting on it, coming to know it and
                                putting oneself into it (Pierce, Kostova
                                and Dirks 2001).
    its fate is hers            How it fares is felt, whatever the turn did
                                for her otherwise. To care about a thing is
                                to be invested in it, so that one gains and
                                loses with it (Frankfurt 1982), and the
                                feelings have the thing as their focus: glad
                                when it does well, hurt when it does not
                                (Helm 2001).
    it reaches what it touches  What comes with a cared-for thing is of
                                interest for its sake. Activation spreads
                                along association and thins with how many
                                other things the associate also keeps
                                company with (Collins and Loftus 1975;
                                Anderson 1983).

The measure is one currency, her own turns. Every turn a thing was in was
either brought to her or given by her. `share` is the part of all the turns
she has given that went to this thing, read at the lower end of what the
counts allow (Clopper and Pearson 1934), so one turn given to one thing is a
twentieth and not the whole of her. She `cares` when that part stands above
an even split over everything she could have given a turn to, by the exact
test and at the level the record's likes are read at.

`stake` is what a thing's fate is worth to her: its own share, and what
reaches it from each thing it keeps company with, that thing's share times
the part of this thing's turns it was in. A thing she has given nothing to
has a stake when it only ever arrives with something she has.

`fared` is how she learns a thing went well or badly. What she feels of it
is the stake times how it went, and that is all: with no stake the news is
news. The feeling belongs to the news and not to the thing, so the record
takes it out of the turn before it reads what the thing itself was worth to
her, and hearing that somebody she cares about is ill does not teach her to
like them less.

Nothing here reads what a sentence says.
