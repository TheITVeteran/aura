"""core/fsw/assertions.py — FW_ASSERT.

Clean-room adoption of F Prime's assertion mechanism.

Python's `assert` is the wrong tool for a long-running autonomous system,
for two independent reasons. It is removed under `-O`, so an assertion is
either present or silently absent depending on how the process was
launched — and "silently absent" is the mode you discover during an
incident. And when it does fire it raises `AssertionError` with a message
and nothing else: no file, no line, no argument values, no record that
survives the traceback being swallowed by an `except Exception` three
frames up. Aura has a great many of those `except` blocks, by design.

F Prime's `FW_ASSERT` is built differently, and the differences are all
the point:

* It **always runs**. There is no build mode where the check disappears.
* It **records** the file, the line, and up to a few argument values into
  a dedicated assertion log that survives the process.
* It **triggers a declared response** rather than an exception. Flight
  software usually restarts on assertion failure, because a violated
  invariant means the state is not what the code believes and continuing
  is a guess. What it never does is continue *silently*.

Aura's declared responses:

* ``RECORD`` — log it, taint the runtime, keep going. For invariants
  whose violation is informative but survivable.
* ``RAISE`` — record, then raise :class:`AssertionFailure`. For code paths
  where the caller genuinely can handle it.
* ``RESTART`` — record, then request a controlled restart. For invariants
  whose violation means the in-memory state is untrustworthy.

Every failure taints the runtime, so no later report reads clean over a
broken invariant.
