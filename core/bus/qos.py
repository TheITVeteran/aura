"""core/bus/qos.py — quality-of-service profiles for the event bus.

Clean-room adoption of the DDS/ROS 2 QoS model, layered over Aura's
existing `AuraEventBus` rather than replacing it.

An event bus with one delivery policy forces every topic into the same
trade-off, and the trade-offs genuinely differ:

* A **sensor stream** should be best-effort with history depth 1. The
  newest sample is the only one that matters; queuing stale frames behind
  a slow consumer makes the consumer see the past.
* A **state announcement** — "the model lane is warm", "autonomy is
  paused" — must be *transient-local*: a subscriber that starts after the
  announcement still needs to know. This is the single biggest gap in a
  volatile-only bus, and it produces exactly the bug Aura has hit: an
  organ boots after a state event and behaves as though the state never
  changed, forever, because nothing will republish it.
* A **command** must be reliable and must not silently vanish under
  backpressure.
* A **heartbeat** wants a *deadline*: not receiving it is the signal.
  Without deadline QoS, absence is invisible — you can only notice a
  message you received.

The other half of the ROS 2 model, and the half people forget, is **QoS
compatibility**. A subscriber requesting stronger guarantees than the
publisher offers does not silently degrade — in DDS it simply never
connects, which is the classic afternoon-losing ROS bug. Here the
mismatch is *reported*, loudly, at subscribe time, and the subscription is
still made with the offered policy. An incompatibility you can see beats
both silent degradation and silent disconnection.
