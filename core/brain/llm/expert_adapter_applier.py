"""MLX applier for the expert-LoRA library — the live worker seam.

Bridges ``ExpertLoRALibrary`` residency to the resident worker model via
``MLXLocalClient.set_expert_adapter`` (an in-worker wrap of target linears +
adapter weight load; no model reload). The worker holds AT MOST ONE expert
adapter, so this applier serializes swaps and treats "load B" as the atomic
swap "detach A, attach B" the worker already implements.

Honesty contract: ``load``/``unload`` return what the worker actually did.
A busy lane (generation in flight) refuses the swap — callers try again at
the next idle moment; nothing queues silently against a model whose weights
must not change mid-decode.
