"""Register the reasoning background loops on the autonomy conductor.

Two bounded, internal, governed loops complete the flywheel:

* ``reasoning_idle_precompute`` — drains the precompute queue during idle, solving
  verifier-dirty hard problems off the foreground critical path; wins land in the
  solved-cache for instant re-use.
* ``reasoning_self_improve`` — when enough verifier-clean traces accumulate, feeds
  them to the existing governed/validated fine-tune pipe (STaR bootstrap).

Wiring (one line, where the conductor's defaults are registered)::

    from core.brain.reasoning_background import register_reasoning_jobs
    register_reasoning_jobs(conductor)

Idempotent: registering twice is a no-op. Kept out of the conductor module itself so
this lands without entangling concurrent edits there.
