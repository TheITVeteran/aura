"""Courtroom — adversarial multi-role reasoning over a single local model.

You make a smaller model act smarter than itself by forcing *adversarial* cognition:
the same Cortex plays isolated roles that do not see each other's drafts until after
they have each spoken independently, then a judge rules on the assembled record.

    Solver          produces candidate answer(s) with its reasoning
    Skeptic         independently lists how answers like this usually go wrong,
                    then attacks the Solver's actual answer
    Evidence clerk  assembles the grounding (supplied evidence + retrieved facts)
    Verifier        runs the deterministic truth engines (not an LLM opinion)
    Simplifier      reduces the winning answer to its minimal correct form
    Judge           rules on candidates + objections + verifier verdict + evidence

This is slower but local, and it is gated behind the amplifier's DEEP/EXTREME modes
so it only runs when the stakes justify the spend.
