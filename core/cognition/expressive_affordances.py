"""Expressive affordances — the mind's menu of ways to act, not scripts.

Bryan's question: does Aura KNOW she can use her mind — that when an idea is
better shown than said, she can generate an image; that "I need a table"
means clarify-then-demonstrate on the real machine; that she can ask for a
photo, model out scenarios, or examine a file deeply — and does she CHOOSE
these from general cognition rather than hardcoded trigger paths?

The architecture answer is not a router of if/elif keyword matches. It is:

  1. a typed registry of AFFORDANCES (capabilities framed as things the mind
     can decide to do), each with a plain-language "when you'd reach for this"
     description and a governed realizer;
  2. a compact menu injected into the generation context so the model reasons
     WITH its own affordances present, the way a person knows their own hands
     are available;
  3. an intent grammar — the model emits ``⟦affordance:name arg=...⟧`` inline
     when its own judgment says an action would serve the moment;
  4. a parser + governed executor that realizes the chosen affordance and
     attaches the result to the reply.

This keeps the DECISION in general cognition (the model chooses, by context
and inference) while the MECHANISM stays a clean, extensible, governed layer.
Adding a new affordance is one registry entry; no new routing code.
