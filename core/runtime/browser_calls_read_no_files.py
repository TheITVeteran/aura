"""Her browser's calls, without a walk of the file system on every one.

Playwright's Python client wraps each call to the browser (a key down, the
pointer moved, a frame acknowledged) in ``inspect.stack(0)``. For every frame
on the stack that asks the file system whether the frame's source file exists
and checks the line cache. The client then uses three things of each frame:
its file's name, its line, and the frame itself.

Measured 2026-10-12: 0.67 ms a call at a stack 45 deep, against 0.014 ms for
reading the same three things off the frames. Through one game 7% of her main
thread went to it, thirty frames a second acknowledged at that price, and
every key she pressed in time waited on it.

``install()`` gives the client's connection module a stand-in for ``inspect``
whose ``stack`` reads the frames directly. Everything else it is asked for is
the real module's. What the client makes of the stack (the name of the call
in its error messages, where it was called from) comes out the same; the test
holds the two side by side.

The client also keeps the last ten frames of each call as a traceback, for an
error to show. ``traceback.extract_stack`` checks every one of those files
against the disk as it takes them. The stand-in for ``traceback`` takes the
same frames and leaves their lines to be read if the traceback is ever shown.
