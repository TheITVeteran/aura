"""core/runtime/taint.py — the runtime taint register.

Clean-room adoption of the Linux kernel's taint-flag discipline
(`/proc/sys/kernel/tainted`, `add_taint()`, the `Tainted: G W L` line on
every oops).

The rule the kernel enforces and Aura did not: **once something happened
that invalidates the assumptions the rest of the system reasons under, no
later report is allowed to look clean.** A kernel that force-loaded an
unsigned module, or that already hit a WARN, prints its taint on every
subsequent bug report forever — because the person reading report #2 needs
to know report #1 happened, and a fresh-looking oops from a corrupt machine
wastes days.

Aura's failure mode is the same shape and is documented in
KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md: a subsystem degrades, a fallback silently absorbs
it, and thirty minutes later the health endpoint says HEALTHY. The health
endpoint is not lying about *now*; it simply has no memory. This module is
that memory.

Semantics, deliberately matching the kernel:

* Taint is **one-way**. Nothing clears a flag except process restart. There
  is no `untaint()` and adding one would defeat the purpose. (A test-only
  reset exists, gated on the test-mode predicate, for suite hygiene.)
* Taint is **cheap and always on**. Setting a flag is a dict write under a
  lock; reading is a copy. No flag gates it.
* Taint is **carried, not judged**. This module does not decide whether the
  runtime should stop. It records that an assumption broke and lets
  health, the incident narrator, the diagnostics bundle, and the flight
  recorder carry it.

Every taint carries the first reason, the first timestamp, and an
occurrence count, so `Tainted: DL (2)` expands to a real story.
