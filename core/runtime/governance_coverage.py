"""Turns that reached cognition without a governance decision.

``core/orchestrator/mixins/message_handling.py`` carried this comment above
its Unified Will gate:

    ALL processing — user-facing or internal — must pass through the
    Unified Will. This is THE architectural invariant that makes Aura a
    unified intelligence rather than a federation.

It was not true, in three ways. The Somatic Reflex Bypass returns before the
gate for embodied-control contracts, which is deliberate and documented. The
gate is wrapped in ``if will._started:``, so every message before governance
comes up is ungated. And the gate's own ``except`` records a degradation and
continues.

The first is a designed exception. The other two were silent, and that is
the part that matters: a turn nobody governed was indistinguishable
afterwards from a turn the Will approved. This codebase has a name for that
shape — the absence of a check reported as a passed check — and here it sat
on the governance boundary itself.

Counting, not refusing. Refusing would take the conversation offline every
time governance hiccups, and a control that breaks working capability is one
somebody routes around. What must not happen is that it goes unrecorded, so
the count reaches ``runtime_health_report()["integrity"]["ungoverned_turns"]``
and a green verdict can carry the caveat.

This lives in ``core/runtime`` rather than beside the gate because the health
surface reads it, and the foundation may not import upward — the same reason
the admission-throughput estimator registers itself instead of being imported.
