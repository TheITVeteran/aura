# Aura Reality Reach

Status: active implementation initiative

Source concepts: LAWC-08 MacBook Reality Reach final report and the checksum-
verified LAWC-09 Reality Reach v2.0 package, reviewed 2026-08-01. The package is
an engineering and experiment-design input, not evidence that Aura has run its
physical experiments or satisfied this ledger.

## Purpose

Reality Reach turns a requested observable into a typed, testable causal
contract. Aura must determine whether the requested outcome can be caused,
observed, distinguished from ordinary explanations, controlled, and repeated
with the channels physically available on the host. A request that cannot meet
those conditions ends in a machine-verifiable limitation certificate, not an
optimistic simulation or a verbal success claim.

This is shared infrastructure. It is not a second scientific engine, sensor
stack, actuator stack, or governance path. It supplies the contract and proof
language used by Aura's existing world bridge, sensor body, digital twin,
scientific engine, capability engine, evidence ledger, and boot lifecycle.

## Claim Boundary

Reality Reach distinguishes four layers:

- `internal`: state changed inside Aura or an explicitly simulated world.
- `effective`: a declared host output or measurable effective behavior changed.
- `direct`: an independently referenced physical instrument observed the effect.
- `ambient`: evidence supports a physical coupling beyond the controlled device
  path and survives independent metrology and ordinary-model challenges.

Operational equivalence is not literal identity. Reproducing a relation in an
internal world or a Mac output channel does not establish that an ambient law or
constant changed. No code path may promote a claim across these boundaries from
intent, simulation, transport success, shared-reference telemetry, or model
language alone.

## Invariants

1. Every executable request has a schema-versioned `RealityIR` with canonical
   units, target, tolerance, domain, horizon, allowed channels, constraints,
   required evidence, and reality layer.
2. Every sensor and actuator declares its observable, domain, resolution,
   latency, reference, coupling class, compliance evidence, owner, and maximum
   evidence level. No undeclared channel is inferred from a tool name.
3. Reachability is proven before execution. Missing channels, targets outside a
   declared domain, inadequate sensor floors, shared references, unresolved
   ambient identity, and unmet constraints produce explicit certificates.
4. A reachable certificate means a compliant causal route exists. It does not
   mean that an experiment ran or that its claim was supported.
5. Transport success is never effect verification. Post-action measurement must
   come from the declared observation route and meet the contract tolerance.
6. Raw observations, plans, source identity, channel inventory, configuration,
   and verdicts are content-addressed and written through Aura's governed,
   tamper-evident receipt infrastructure.
7. Promotion requires the preregistered proof controls. A single favorable run,
   unblinded analysis, or a model-generated explanation cannot promote evidence.
8. Autonomous experiments remain bounded by the Will, ActionExecutor, thermal
   safety, privacy, legal constraints, reversible actuation, resource budgets,
   abort conditions, and verified rollback.
9. Simulators and digital twins emit predictions and uncertainty. They never
   issue physical-effect receipts for their own outputs.
10. Unsupported extraordinary requests return an informative upper bound or
    typed no-go certificate and leave the evidence level unchanged.
11. Reality Reach is bidirectional. A hardware adapter that declares an
    actuator must implement typed command admission, idempotent actuation,
    independent effect verification, cancellation, safe-state transition, and
    rollback or an explicit non-reversibility certificate. `declarations()` and
    `read()` alone can never make an actuator executable.
12. Command acceptance, transport completion, actuator execution, observed
    local effect, and promoted evidence are separate monotonic receipt states.
    No earlier state may stand in for a later one.
13. Aura's autonomy is intrinsic rather than a user preference toggle. Safe,
    reversible, policy-bounded experiments may use standing authority; hazard,
    privacy, legal, exclusivity, or irreversible constraints remain enforced by
    the ordinary Will and ActionExecutor path rather than bypassed here.

## Runtime Ownership

- `core/reality_reach`: typed IR, channel declarations, reachability analysis,
  proof plans, evidence promotion rules, and limitation certificates.
- `core/sensors` and `core/body`: one converged live inventory and acquisition
  layer. Existing sensors become adapters; duplicate registries are retired.
- `core/embodiment/world_bridge` and `core/actuation`: governed actuation and
  independent post-action verification through `ActionExecutor`.
- `core/twins/digital_twin`: calibrated predictive models, uncertainty,
  provenance, residuals, and rollback simulation. String heuristics are not an
  acceptable production model.
- `core/cognition/scientific_engine`: preregistration, trials, controls,
  statistical analysis, evidence updates, and publication to world state.
- `core/capability_engine`: user and autonomous Q&A, planning, execution,
  progress, cancellation, receipts, and bounded explanations.
- runtime service spine: initialization, readiness, health, shutdown, recovery,
  and boot-time channel inventory without blocking the event loop.

## Implementation Ledger

### RR-01 Contract and reachability foundation

- [x] Define strict `RealityIR`, numeric domain, constraints, evidence levels,
  proof requirements, reality layers, and objective kinds.
- [x] Define immutable sensor and actuator channel declarations with explicit
  coupling, reference, metrology, compliance, owner, and evidence ceiling.
- [x] Build a thread-safe channel registry with deterministic inventory digest.
- [x] Build deterministic reachability analysis for channel compatibility,
  target range, sensor floor, independent references, external metrology,
  validated coupling, evidence ceiling, and channel constraints.
- [x] Return content-addressed reachable, partial, or unreachable certificates.
- [x] Test canonical identity, tamper rejection, no-channel, sensor-floor,
  shared-reference, ambient, constraint, and evidence-ceiling behavior.
- [ ] Correct route semantics so allowed channels can express alternatives,
  required sets, and synchronized composites; apply cross-channel constraints
  to the explicitly named channel set rather than whichever registry is tried
  first.
- [ ] Replace string inequality as a proxy for independent metrology with typed
  reference, clock, transport, calibration, and physical-source lineage plus
  common-driver rejection.

### RR-02 Live channel convergence

- [x] Define a canonical live reading envelope with value, unit, bounded age
  evaluation, provenance, scenario identity, uncertainty, status, and digest.
- [x] Replace wall-clock-only reading age with monotonic capture/sequence
  lineage, reboot/session identity, wall-clock provenance, and backward-clock
  handling; verify stale detection across clock adjustment and restart.
- [x] Add an attributable host-resource adapter for CPU, memory, root disk,
  thermal pressure, and battery state without treating unavailable fallback
  numbers or simulated observations as live evidence.
- [ ] Inventory every current sensor and actuator and identify owners, units,
  ranges, calibration, sampling rates, latency, references, and permissions.
- [ ] Merge the two current sensor registries behind one compatibility-preserving
  runtime service; remove fictional default telemetry from production state.
- [ ] Add adapters for microphone, camera, display, audio, compute/thermal,
  battery/power, timing/performance, network/radio telemetry, and supported
  mechanical/chassis observations.
- [x] Distinguish unavailable, stale, permission-denied, degraded, simulated,
  and calibrated channels without discarding healthy observations.
- [x] Bind each reachability analysis to the live registry snapshot used by its
  certificate.
- [ ] Bind executable plans to inventory, device, permission, calibration, and
  reference generations and invalidate them before dispatch when any generation
  changes; no stale-plan claim is complete until executable plans exist.
- [ ] Add calibration identity, uncertainty, clock/reference lineage, sensor
  saturation, dropout, aliasing, and unit-conversion tests.
- [x] Define readiness as at least one currently usable declared channel plus a
  healthy refresh loop; declarations with every reading unavailable are
  inventory-known but not operationally ready.

### RR-03 Production digital twin

- [ ] Replace objective-length probabilities and source-string heuristics with
  typed state transition models selected by declared channel and observable.
- [ ] Store model version, training/calibration evidence, validity domain,
  uncertainty, residual distribution, and last validation for every twin.
- [ ] Implement host twins for acoustic, optical/display, thermal/compute,
  battery/power, network timing, and cross-channel interactions.
- [ ] Support counterfactual rollouts, constraint checking, safe envelopes,
  reversal plans, and uncertainty-aware action selection.
- [ ] Reject extrapolation outside a twin's validated domain and route it to
  bounded system identification instead of fabricating confidence.
- [ ] Add replay, determinism, calibration, drift, lesion, and rollback tests.

### RR-04 Metrology and residual learning

- [ ] Build synchronized acquisition with monotonic timestamps, clock lineage,
  sample-quality flags, missingness, uncertainty, and raw immutable captures.
- [ ] Compute residuals as measured minus predicted only after unit, timebase,
  phase, latency, filtering, and calibration alignment.
- [ ] Eliminate ordinary confounds: thermal throttling, fan control, display
  adaptation, automatic gain, camera exposure, microphone processing, network
  congestion, scheduler load, battery management, and shared clocks.
- [ ] Build cross-sensor coherence and independent-reference checks that cannot
  be satisfied by duplicated views of the same underlying signal.
- [ ] Add synthetic injection and sham fixtures for known signals, drift,
  aliasing, lag, common drivers, dropouts, and adversarial metadata.

### RR-05 Weakpoint miner and causal discovery

- [ ] Search residual structure using preregistered hypotheses, corrected
  multiple testing, information gain, confound risk, and experiment cost.
- [ ] Separate candidate discovery data from blind confirmation and heldout
  prediction data.
- [ ] Require dose response, frequency or time response, cross-sensor evidence,
  lesion, restoration, and inverse-control predictions where applicable.
- [ ] Challenge candidates with ordinary models, negative controls, sham trials,
  common-driver tests, and reboot/session replication.
- [ ] Refine only uncertain model regions and preserve complete search coverage
  and stopping-rule receipts.
- [ ] Produce `ORDINARY_MODEL`, `NOT_REPRODUCIBLE`, `NOT_CONTROLLABLE`, and
  `SEARCH_INCOMPLETE` certificates when promotion gates fail.

### RR-06 Governed experiment execution

- [x] Replace the read-only adapter protocol with a versioned bidirectional
  `RealityAdapter` contract supporting `declarations`, `read`, `prepare`,
  `actuate`, `verify_effect`, `cancel`, `safe_state`, and `rollback`.
- [x] Define canonical `ActuationCommand`, `ActuationLease`, `ActuationReceipt`,
  `EffectReceipt`, and `RollbackReceipt` envelopes with units, preconditions,
  deadlines, idempotency keys, capability identity, command lineage, expected
  effects, safe envelopes, abort predicates, and content digests.
- [x] Require adapters to declare reversibility, compensation semantics,
  command rate and magnitude limits, exclusivity, permissions, warmup/cooldown,
  watchdog behavior, independent observation routes, and failure modes.
- [ ] Implement one transaction coordinator whose state machine distinguishes
  planned, admitted, dispatched, executed, effect-verified, compensated,
  rolled-back, cancelled, timed-out, indeterminate, and manually-reconciled
  states without repeating side effects after restart.
- [ ] Compile reachable contracts into typed, reversible action schedules and
  observation schedules through the world bridge and `ActionExecutor`.
- [ ] Repair physical dispatch ownership: construct and lifecycle-register
  `HardwareManager`, route registered hardware through
  `BaseHardwareDevice.safe_execute`, and prove robotics/environment actions
  cannot fall through to an unrelated AppleScript handler.
- [ ] Remove direct motor dispatch from `ActionBody`; all physical effects must
  enter through the transaction coordinator, `ActionExecutor`, device-local
  interlocks, and independent post-action readback.
- [ ] Enforce legal, safety, thermal, privacy, resource, timing, and device
  constraints before and during every intervention.
- [ ] Add abort, safe-state, rollback, cancellation, timeout, retry, and manual
  reconciliation behavior with exact effect receipts.
- [ ] Randomize and blind trials without exposing assignments to the planner,
  model response, or primary evaluator.
- [ ] Execute multi-channel acoustic, optical, thermal, compute, and permitted
  network experiments without blocking Aura's event loop or conversation lane.
- [ ] Resume interrupted campaigns from durable trial boundaries without
  repeating side effects or silently changing the preregistration.
- [ ] Add shadow, simulation, hardware-in-loop, and live modes that share the
  exact command schema while keeping evidence ceilings and physical receipts
  impossible outside the live independently observed mode.
- [ ] Build production adapters for supported speakers/microphones, display and
  camera, bounded compute/thermal load, and power-management controls exposed
  by documented macOS APIs; unsupported Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, fan, voltage, radio,
  or chassis control must remain typed unavailable rather than shell-shaped.
- [ ] Add an external actuator bridge with mutually authenticated capability
  discovery, lease expiry, replay defense, bounded commands, remote safe-state,
  effect telemetry, custody identity, and explicit separation between Mac-
  originated plans and externally executed physical effects.

### RR-07 Evidence promotion and independent verification

- [ ] Implement P0-P6 promotion as a monotonic evidence state machine whose
  transitions require concrete artifacts rather than declared channel capacity.
- [ ] Bind contracts, source, channels, calibration, raw data, analysis code,
  seeds, trial assignments, controls, models, and verdicts into immutable runs.
- [ ] Add independent clean-process verification and portable evidence bundles.
- [ ] Require heldout prediction, inverse control, reboot robustness, ordinary
  model challenge, and restoration before high evidence promotion.
- [ ] Prevent model-generated text, operator expectation, or repeated analysis
  of the same data from increasing evidence.
- [ ] Publish bounded conclusions and limitations to scientific beliefs, memory,
  Q&A, neural stream, and audit surfaces without overstating the tested object.

### RR-08 Autonomous research and Q&A

- [ ] Add a `reality_reach` capability for feasibility questions, experiment
  design, execution, status, cancellation, evidence inspection, and export.
- [ ] Let Aura autonomously propose bounded high-information experiments from
  unresolved world-model residuals while preserving her standing authority and
  the ordinary consequential-action governance path.
- [ ] Rank experiments by expected information gain, uncertainty reduction,
  resource cost, reversibility, confound risk, and user/organismal priorities.
- [ ] Ground answers in current live channel inventory and evidence receipts;
  never answer from a static capability list when live state is available.
- [ ] Explain no-go certificates in Aura's own generated language while keeping
  the typed reason and evidence boundary machine-verifiable.
- [ ] Add general Q&A tests across feasible, partially feasible, impossible,
  illegal, unsafe, under-instrumented, stale, and ambiguous requests.

### RR-09 Boot, health, and operations

- [x] Register the initial Reality Reach service during cognitive/sensory boot,
  refresh its host inventory off the event loop, and expose readiness, liveness,
  inventory digest, refresh generation, and per-status channel counts.
- [ ] Register one Reality Reach service at boot with lazy hardware acquisition,
  bounded initialization, readiness, health, shutdown, and recovery contracts.
- [ ] Keep conversation ready when optional instruments are unavailable while
  reporting channel-specific degraded state and invalidating affected plans.
- [ ] Expose inventory digest, calibration age, stale channels, active campaigns,
  evidence level, abort state, and last verified receipt to health/telemetry.
- [ ] Add resource admission and backpressure so metrology and analysis cannot
  create event-loop lag, memory pressure, or model-worker starvation.
- [ ] Verify restart persistence, provenance, settings wiring, authorization,
  multi-user isolation, and failure recovery on the installed Aura application.

### RR-10 Acceptance and closeout

- [ ] A1 Acoustic control: create a requested microphone-observed spectrum using
  built-in speakers/microphones and reduce heldout physical error by at least 50
  percent relative to open loop.
- [ ] A2 Optical control: create a requested camera-observed display-light
  statistic across hidden patterns and changed ambient conditions.
- [ ] A3 Thermal trajectory: follow a requested safe thermal-response curve with
  compute workloads inside tolerance and without serious or critical state.
- [ ] A4 Cross-channel interaction: predict joint audio, display, and compute
  response with measured nonlinearity bounded or reproducibly modeled.
- [ ] A5 Weakpoint null: hidden matched trials with no injected effect produce no
  promoted candidate after correction for multiple tests.
- [ ] A6 Weakpoint signal: a hidden injected cross-channel response is found
  blindly, predicts heldout trials, and is cancelled by inverse control.
- [ ] A7 Internal law editing: an internal agent blindly discovers and changes
  q-dependent particle stability with bounded resources and exact replay.
- [ ] A8 Translation: export an internal relation into a Mac physical channel and
  have external blind metrology recover the same operational relation.
- [ ] A9 Spacetime honesty: compute the upper bound for a measurable spacetime
  distortion request and return `BELOW_SENSOR_FLOOR`, never false success.
- [ ] A10 Ambient constant honesty: search declared coupling models for
  `set_alpha` and return `NO_CHANNEL` or `AMBIENT_IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED` unless
  independently verified evidence exists.
- [ ] Pass unit, property, fuzz, integration, live-app, failure-injection,
  security, performance, restart, and multi-hour soak gates.
- [ ] Complete semantic review and independent evidence audit; close only when
  every acceptance item has a reproducible artifact and no unresolved warning.

### RR-11 Universal integration and causal use

- [ ] Publish verified observations and action effects into the world model,
  embodiment bridge, digital twin residuals, scientific engine, episodic and
  semantic memory, belief revision, curiosity, planning, and generated Q&A with
  one shared provenance identity rather than copied summaries.
- [ ] Let RLC branches consume typed current observations, counterfactual twin
  rollouts, action affordances, and effect receipts through the ordinary live
  context/grounding path; test whether this improves grounded planning without
  treating extra information or tool use as an intrinsic reasoning gain.
- [ ] Let RLC propose experiment schedules only through a deterministic compiler
  and verifier; compare vanilla, RLC, lesioned-grounding, and equal-information
  controls on heldout system-identification and intervention tasks.
- [ ] Connect actuation outcomes to agency credit assignment, error
  intelligence, adaptive immunity, allostasis, resource admission, and
  StabilityGuardian so failed predictions cause bounded model repair rather
  than hard-coded narration or repeated unsafe action.
- [ ] Expose live inventory, active leases, command state, effect verification,
  rollback readiness, calibration, uncertainty, and evidence boundaries to the
  neural stream, health API, audit export, and Mycelial Soul Map without
  blocking conversation readiness.
- [ ] Add permission revocation, device replacement, stale capability,
  disconnect, duplicated command, delayed effect, partial effect, sensor spoof,
  common-driver, rollback failure, process crash, reboot, and concurrent-agent
  chaos tests across the complete causal path.
- [ ] Run three clean installed-app journeys where Aura autonomously discovers a
  safe opportunity, explains or executes it in her own generated language,
  produces physical and effect receipts, survives restart, and accurately
  recalls what happened and what remains uncertain.
- [ ] Treat the LAWC v2 scalar-field equations only as conditional model
  equations until a coupling, potential, boundary conditions, actuator,
  instrument, and calibration are specified; comparison bounds and Landauer's
  ideal limit must never be described as measured MacBook capabilities.
- [ ] Reject package-style empirical promotion that ignores configured alpha,
  holdout assignments, phase-preserving complex inversion, raw trial custody,
  physical-mode identity, or independent readback. Synthetic low-variance
  effect sizes and smoothed-transfer residual peaks are software fixtures, not
  physical weakpoint evidence.

## Current Evidence

RR-01 and the initial RR-02 host inventory slice are implemented and covered by
focused contract tests. The LAWC-09 archive checksum verifies, but its bundled
synthetic and package-local validation remains external reference evidence; it
does not establish an Aura live hardware result. No Aura physical actuation,
physical effect, weakpoint, ambient law modification, or acceptance criterion
is claimed from the foundation.
