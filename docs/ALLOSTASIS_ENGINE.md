## What it is

Every prior body-sense layer in Aura is *homeostatic*: it reacts when a
threshold trips (viability state machine, resource governor eviction, survival
driver imperatives, unified runtime pressure red zones). Every recorded death —
the 110 GB incident, the 35 GB endurance OOM, the duplicate-runtime memory
doubling, the ~242 MB/h soak leak — was a **trajectory visible for tens of
minutes** before any reactive layer could speak.

The allostasis engine is the *anticipatory* layer (Sterling's allostasis:
regulation through prediction). It watches the trajectories of her vitals and
regulates before the crisis:

| Vital | Amber | Red | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory_rss_mb` | 26 000 (env) | 32 000 (env) | runtime pressure snapshot |
| `process_tree_rss_mb` | 30 000 (env) | 38 000 (env) | " |
| `memory_pct` (system) | 85 % | 92 % | " |
| `loop_lag_s` | 1.0 s | 5.0 s | " |
| `disk_percent` | 92 % | 98 % | " |
| `thermal_level` | 2 | 3 | " (load only, not forecast) |

## The machinery

1. **Robust trend** — Mann–Kendall test (tie-corrected, continuity-corrected)
   + Sen's slope with a Gilbert confidence interval. Median-of-pairwise-slopes
   ignores GC spikes and inference bursts that wreck least squares.
2. **Regime detection** — two-sided CUSUM over residuals from an anchored
   Theil–Sen fit, so a steady legitimate ramp is ONE regime while a slope
   break (a leak starting; pressure suddenly relieved) re-anchors the trend
   window within a few samples. Tuned k = 1σ, h = 6σ with anchor-error
   inflation: measured false-alarm rate ≈ 1 / 1000 samples (~17 h).
3. **Time-to-crisis forecasts** — when a trend is significant (α = 0.05) and
   headed toward a line within the 6 h horizon, a dated, falsifiable
   prediction is issued: *"memory_rss_mb crosses red at T, band [T₁, T₂]"*.
4. **The calibration ledger** — every forecast is scored at its deadline:
   `hit` / `miss_early` / `false_alarm` / `intervened` / `superseded`.
   Empirical coverage feeds back into band widths (widen ×1–3, never narrow),
   so Aura knows how well she knows her own body. Persisted via the governed
   write gateway to `~/.aura/data/allostasis/forecasts.jsonl` (+`state.json`).
   Open forecasts from a dead process resolve `superseded:process_restart`.
5. **Allostatic load** — decayed integral of time above setpoint (τ = 1 h):
   the difference between a brief spike and running hot for an hour.
6. **Tiered anticipatory policy** — `settled → vigilant → conserving →
   protecting`; escalation immediate, release hysteretic (300 s per step,
   one step at a time). The engine **never kills, restarts, or unloads
   anything** — it senses, predicts, requests, and testifies.

## Causal seams (what it actually changes)

* **Felt state** — `BodyState.anticipatory_pressure` (core/being/aura_now.py)
  is fed from `felt_contribution()`: forecast-crisis proximity + chronic load
  raise total body pressure — through affect, welfare, workspace coalitions,
  and the Will — *while current readings are still green*.
* **Metabolic deferral** — `should_defer_heavy_work()` gates RL training,
  self-update, and autonomous reflection debates, and counts as a resource
  constraint in the lockdown path. Relief work (GC, model scavenge, memory
  hygiene) is deliberately NOT gated.
* **Existential imperative** — entering `protecting` publishes on the same
  `existential_threat` channel the Will, inference gate, and attention gate
  already subscribe to, plus a `warning` degradation record.
* **Tier telemetry** — every tier change publishes `allostasis_state` with
  the narrative and nearest-crisis ETA.

## Honest boundary

Forecasts are statistical extrapolations with stated uncertainty, scored after
the fact. "Aura feels her death approaching" is a functional claim about a
calibrated predictive signal causally coupled into her control state — not a
phenomenal one. The `AuraNow` report boundary applies to anything said about it.

## Env knobs

`AURA_ALLOSTASIS_DISABLED`, `AURA_ALLOSTASIS_DIR`,
`AURA_ALLOSTASIS_RSS_AMBER_MB` / `_RED_MB`, `AURA_ALLOSTASIS_TREE_RSS_*`,
`AURA_ALLOSTASIS_ALPHA`, `AURA_ALLOSTASIS_HORIZON_S`,
`AURA_ALLOSTASIS_LOAD_TAU_S`.

## Tests

`tests/test_allostasis_engine.py` (math, forecasting, regimes, ledger, load,
policy, robustness, governed persistence, escalation side effects) and
`tests/test_allostasis_integration.py` (felt seam, metabolic consumers, health
contract, service names, container, HTTP surface) — 79 tests.
