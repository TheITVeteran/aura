# Dependency Audit Policy

`make audit-deps` runs `pip-audit` over the installed environment and fails
on any known vulnerability that is not explicitly waived. Waivers live in
the `AUDIT_WAIVERS` variable in the Makefile and each one must be recorded
here with its justification and revisit condition. A waiver without a
written justification is a policy violation, not a configuration choice.

`tools/runtime_preflight.py` separately reports drift between installed
package versions and `requirements_lock.txt` pins, so the audited
environment and the declared environment cannot silently diverge.

## Active waivers

### CVE-2025-3000 — torch `torch.jit.script` memory corruption

- **Waived:** 2026-07-12
- **Installed:** torch 2.11.0; **no fixed release exists upstream.**
- **Why waived:** the vulnerable function is `torch.jit.script`; a repo-wide
  grep (enforced inline in the `audit-deps` target — the waiver self-revokes
  if a call site ever appears) shows zero call sites. Attack vector is
  local-host only; torch here processes Aura's own tensors (plasticity /
  lattice / vector-memory math), never untrusted serialized models.
- **Revisit when:** a fixed torch release ships (then upgrade and drop the
  waiver), or any code starts using `torch.jit` (the gate fails closed).
