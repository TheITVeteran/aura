"""tools/what_an_utterance_asks_of_her.py — is an invitation told from a request?

Reads a set of utterances with core/together/what_was_proposed.py on her fast
model and prints what each was read as. The reference each second part is set
against is her own stored messages, as it is when she runs.

The sentences below were written on 13 October 2026 before the reader was run
on them, a dozen invitations and a dozen requests about the same things among
them. They are a held-out set: do not edit the reader to them.
