"""tools/check_evidence_integrity.py — a claim may not outrank its evidence.

Claim 14 (AGI-Candidate) sat at `locally demonstrated` for a month while the
same table cell explained that its primary evidence was an unfair comparison:
baselines strangled at 160 tokens against an effectively unbounded,
solver-assisted treatment, on tasks that cannot be answered inside 160 tokens.
The retraction and the classification lived side by side and the classification
won, because nothing checked.

Two things had to be true for that to happen, and this gate closes both:

1.  The retraction was PROSE. `BASELINES.json` still read `"status": "RUN"`
    with clean pass rates, so every automated consumer saw a passing artifact.
    Evidence whose validity has been withdrawn now carries a machine-readable
    `RETRACTION.json` beside it.

2.  Nothing derived a claim's ceiling from the state of its evidence. A claim
    now cannot be classified above `not proven` while citing a retracted
    artifact.

This does not decide whether evidence is good. It enforces the one thing that
should never need judgement: a claim cannot be stronger than the evidence it
names, and a retraction must reach every claim that leans on it.
