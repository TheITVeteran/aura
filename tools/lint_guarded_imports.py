"""Guarded imports must name something that exists.

A first-party import inside ``try: ... except ImportError:`` is how this
codebase makes a feature optional. It is also how a feature dies without
anyone noticing: rename the symbol, miss the call site, and the handler
turns the resulting ``ImportError`` into "that capability isn't available"
— forever, silently, on every boot.

That is not hypothetical. Found by audit and fixed in the same pass:

* ``OutcomeSimulator`` became ``OutcomeSimulationEngine``, so "model this
  out" ran with no outcome simulation.
* ``WebSearchSkill`` became ``EnhancedWebSearchSkill`` in two research
  paths, so the self-taught builder and the self-code-improver both lost
  their web leg.
* ``get_memory`` never existed on the memory facade, so the builder's
  cumulative learning recalled nothing, every time.
* ``PRIME_DIRECTIVES`` never existed, so the state authority checked topics
  against three hardcoded strings instead of the constitution.

Every one of those looked like a working system with a quiet feature flag.
The blast radius stayed small only because the fallbacks were fail-closed,
which is luck, not design.

This gate resolves the symbol statically. It understands module-level
``__getattr__`` (PEP 562), ``__all__``, star re-exports, namespace packages,
and submodule imports, because all four are load-bearing here. What it will
not accept is a guarded import of a name that nothing defines.
