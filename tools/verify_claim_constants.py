"""Every constant a claim cites must still hold that value in the code.

CLAIMS_MATRIX.md is what an external reviewer reads to learn what this system
does and does not do. Claim 4a said, as current fact, that `DEFAULT_ALPHA` is
5.0 and `_INJECTION_ALPHA_CEILING` clips it to 3.0, and concluded that affect
steering ships below the magnitude at which it changes a token.

c7dcc548a had already fixed that, nine days earlier: alpha became a fraction of
the residual stream, measured on both models, DEFAULT_ALPHA 0.2 with the
ceiling at 0.6 — which is the closure condition claim 4a itself named. The code
moved and the record did not, so an outside reviewer read the matrix, reasoned
correctly from it, and reached a conclusion that had stopped being true.

This repository already refuses claims whose evidence was retracted
(`make evidence-integrity`). It had nothing for a claim whose evidence is a
number in a file that has since changed. Nothing catches a record that is wrong
in the direction of understating, because understating looks like caution.

The extraction is deliberately narrow. It reads an assertion only where the
matrix uses an explicit copula between a backticked identifier and a numeric
literal — "`X` is 5.0", "`X` clips it to 3.0", "`X` derates to 0.35". Prose that
merely mentions a number near a name is not an assertion about that name's
value, and treating it as one would make this gate cry wolf until somebody
turned it off.

Exit code is non-zero when any cited constant no longer holds the cited value,
or when a claim cites a constant that no longer exists.
