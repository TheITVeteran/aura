"""tools/check_claim_lexicon.py — a loaded name must say what it measures.

A reader meets this project through filenames. `test_consciousness_guarantee.py`,
`core/consciousness/qualia_engine.py`, `test_personhood_battery.py` — each of
those names asserts a conclusion, and each one is met long before any ledger
that qualifies it. TESTING.md says "the filenames are historical", which is true
and does not help: the name is what travels into a screenshot, a search result,
a code review, a conversation.

Renaming 118 files would break every doc link and every reference in a shared
checkout, and it would not stop the next loaded name from being added. So the
rule is not about names. It is:

    A module whose NAME carries a loaded term must state, in its module
    docstring, what it operationally measures — on a line beginning
    "Operationally:" or "What this measures:".

That line is a commitment in the reader's path rather than in a ledger they
would have to know to look for. It is greppable, so it can be checked; and it
cannot be satisfied by atmosphere, because it has to finish the sentence "this
measures ...".

Ratcheted, like layering and the enterprise gate: the count of files still
missing the line may only shrink. Fixing 118 docstrings in one pass would be
either rushed or fake, and a gate nobody can go green against gets deleted.
