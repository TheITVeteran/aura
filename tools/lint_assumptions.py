"""Gate: no assumption may claim a checker that does not exist.

A DISCHARGED assumption pointing at a renamed test is worse than an
UNDISCHARGED one. It occupies the slot that would otherwise show up as debt and
reports the system as covered — the exact "absence of a check reported as a
passed check" failure this repository keeps finding in other forms.

This gate is deliberately narrow. It does not judge whether the assumption set
is complete, whether an assumption is wise, or whether the debt is acceptable;
none of that is machine-checkable. It checks the one property that always rots
on its own: that named things exist.

Run: ``python tools/lint_assumptions.py`` / ``--json`` / ``--list``
