"""An advisory objection describes a reply. It must never delete one.

ADVISORY_REASONS has said so in its docstring since it was introduced —
"describe a turn but never destroy it" — but disposition_for did not know
the set existed, so every advisory reason came back REPAIR. At the
conversation-learning gate REPAIR means "do not remember this exchange",
and the exchange was dropped.

The reply that triggered it was correct. "My laptop crashed when Aura used
over 100GB of RAM." answered with "I will treat that as a live desktop
reliability fault and preserve the context." shares no content word with
the question, because it paraphrases instead of echoing — which is what a
good reply does. Overlap zero, verdict reply_abandons_thread, memory gone.
