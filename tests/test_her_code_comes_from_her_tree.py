"""Asked for her code, she must show code that exists.

Live 2026-08-04 13:50. Asked for a snippet of her own source she found
interesting, she produced::

    def manage_load(self):
        current_load = self.get_current_load()
        ...

introduced as "a small part of my cognitive architecture". No file in this
repository contains it. Asked what module it came from she said she had
written it for the conversation — honest, one turn too late, after the
invention had already been served as her code.

The reader that answers this from real files existed the whole time. It ran
only on the DEGRADED path, after generation had already failed, so a healthy
turn never reached it and the question fell through to weights — and a model
asked for its own code will always produce something that looks like code.
