"""Ratchet: no NEW file writes may bypass the atomic write gateway.

CLAUDE.md states the rule — "All consequential file writes go through
core/runtime/file_write_gateway.py" — and nothing enforced it.

A direct write is not atomic. The old contents are truncated the moment the
file is opened and the new contents land in pieces; a crash, an OOM kill or
a liveness-sentinel SIGKILL between those two moments leaves a truncated
file where durable state used to be. This runtime is killed that way often
enough that the window is not theoretical, and the failure is silent in the
worst way: the next boot reads a valid-looking short file and carries on
with half a state.

The measured answer was good news — core/ and interface/ carry exactly two
direct writes, both crash-time forensic dumps that must NOT use the gateway
(it allocates, locks and fsyncs, and those are precisely what hang when the
loop is already wedged or the allocator is already failing). So this is not
a cleanup; it is the gate that keeps it clean.

If this fails on code you just wrote: use get_file_write_gateway() (or the
*_async methods from async code), or write to a temp path and os.replace.
If you legitimately need a raw write while the process is dying, add it to
EXEMPT_CRASH_DUMPS with the reason.
