"""The titles of a person's private windows were sent to a search engine.

LIVE DEFECT, 2026-08-10, found in ~/.aura/logs. The "required search evidence"
lane in response_generation ran real web searches with these queries:

    query=The Sick Mind of EDP445 | …Documentary - YouTube 🔊
    query=License Plate Lookup & VIN Search | VehicleHistory.us
    query=Monthly Expenses
    query=t get a clear enough answer together, and I

The first three are the titles of Bryan's own windows. The fourth is a
mid-word fragment of Aura's own previous reply. Every one was logged
``origin=user``.

The cause: the query is ``contract.search_query or objective``, and
``objective`` is ``state.cognition.current_objective``, which is NOT always
the user's message — on an ambient or internally-driven turn it holds whatever
perception last put there. ``_clean_required_search_query`` strips formatting
instructions and never asks where the text came from.

Two costs. The evidence is irrelevant to the turn, which is a correctness
problem. And what a person is watching, a VIN lookup, and a document called
"Monthly Expenses" left the machine for an external service that nobody asked
to search anything — which is not reversible, and is the serious one.

So the guard fails closed: no demonstrable relation to the user's own words
means no search.
