"""A revision must pass every check that forced the re-ask.

LIVE DEFECT, 2026-08-10. A reply was re-asked for two reasons at once: it
denied a capability the runtime measured as present, AND it quoted "about 18
seconds" as the retention time of her own memory buffer — Peterson and
Peterson's figure for human short-term memory, from no instrument here.

The acceptance test only re-read the capability claims. The revision stopped
denying, passed, and was served with the invented number still in it — twice
in the same reply. A partial re-check licenses exactly the part it does not
read.
