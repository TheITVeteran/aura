"""World-model state entering the prompt: capped, flattened, screened.

Everything in this section was learned from conversation and used to be placed
in full — every known entity, every relationship, every stored preference, in
whatever order the dicts iterated, with no cap and no screening. A hundred
entities pushed the identity block toward the edge of the window it is supposed
to govern; a stored value carrying a newline could open a section of its own in
a list of dashes; a preference that happened to hold an API key went in
verbatim.
