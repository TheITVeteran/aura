"""A real answer must not be destroyed by its envelope.

Measured live on the desktop path. Aura was asked to open Notes and write a
three-sentence note about orcas. She DID it — the note is on disk:

    Orcas are apex predators known for their intelligence and complex social
    structures. They communicate through a variety of clicks, whistles, and
    pulsed calls. Each pod has its own distinct dialect.

The salvage path then returned the reply as a bare `str`, the delivery boundary
checked `isinstance(response, JSONResponse)`, and the person received:

    The chat route returned an unsupported response format.

Worst possible polarity: the REFUSAL path in the same function was correctly
formed, so a turn that failed reported cleanly while a turn that SUCCEEDED
reported a transport error.
