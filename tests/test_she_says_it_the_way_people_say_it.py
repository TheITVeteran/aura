"""A synthesiser pronounces characters, not meaning.

Kokoro takes plain text and no SSML at all, so everything the listener hears is
decided by the characters handed to it. Nothing turned "$1.5B" into four words,
"45%" into "forty-five percent", "2026-07-27" into a date, or a URL into its
host — which meant the most careful prosody in the world was riding on a clause
that said "colon slash slash".

A mispronounced figure is not a cosmetic problem. It is a wrong answer that
happens to be audible, and the listener has no way to re-read it.

The second job is pacing. With no markup channel, punctuation is the only
prosody instrument the model exposes: a comma is a short breath, a full stop a
longer one. So a speaker's pauses have to be written into the text — carefully,
because inserted punctuation changes intonation too, and too much of it makes
her sound halting rather than considered.

The hard constraint, tested below: this layer may change how a clause is
*pronounced* and never what it claims. It must not alter a number's value, drop
a negation, or reorder a sentence.
