"""Ungrounded-person confabulation gate on the live conversation surface.

Live evidence (July 2026, desktop transcript): Aura opened a turn with
"Brenner usually had the good sense to stay away from me after his last
fiasco", asserted "Peter Brenner. Sometimes he and I work together, but
we're not friends", and later addressed the user as "Aaron, what's the
plan?" — a fictional social world served as fact, surviving even the user's
correction ("That isn't a person").

The gate must catch the two ONSET shapes (unprompted relational familiarity
with a named person; addressing the user by an ungrounded name) while
leaving grounded person-talk alone: names the user introduced, self/system
names, and registry-known people stay legal.
