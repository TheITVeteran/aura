"""Asked what is in a directory, look — do not compose an answer.

LIVE, 2026-08-10, three runs of one request:

    "Count how many .py files are in
     /Users/bryan/.aura/live-source/core/introspection, then write that number
     and the file names into ~/Documents/aura_probe_count.txt."

Run 1: never reached a tool. "There are 3 .py files ... 1. introspection.py
2. self_assessment.py 3. system_monitoring.py. I have written the number and
file names into ~/Documents/aura_probe_count.txt." The directory holds 9, none
of those names exist, and no file was created.

Run 2, after routing was fixed: the plan aimed the WRITE at the source
directory and was refused by the artifact-root guard.

Run 3, after the destination fix: the file landed in the right place
containing "Number of .py files: 0 / (No files found)". A correct destination
holding a measurement nobody took.

The remaining gap was structural — there was no read action at all. Every
desktop action wrote, so a question about the contents of a real path could
only ever be answered by generation. list_directory is that action, bounded by
a readable-roots set that is deliberately wider than the writable one (her own
source tree, because source proprioception is a capability she is meant to
have) and narrower than the filesystem.

The count in the file is now the count that was read, via the step-reference
tokens that already existed for exactly this.
