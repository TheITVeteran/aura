"""CP126 fail-open batch 1: the constitutional spine.

One bug class, four sites — absent or broken governance selecting the
permissive answer:

* ``3da26028`` — strictness was inferred from container presence and a
  lookup failure returned False, so an error chose leniency and the
  pre-registration window was unbounded.
* ``c239ba4d`` — identity writes were approved whenever a heuristic probe
  was inactive, including when the probe itself raised.
* ``71faa1ce`` — one broad handler covered conscience, outcome simulation,
  user advocate and need-to-know, then logged at debug, so a single
  malformed service response disabled every derived restraint.
* ``ab22e91f`` — a missing constitutional gate fell back to a substring
  denylist that accepted everything else.

The shared principle: not knowing whether a restraint applies is not a
licence to skip it. The counterweight, applied deliberately: a guard that
halts the runtime whenever a service hiccups buys no safety and costs
availability, so genuine bootstrap windows are preserved — bounded, and
reported when they expire.
