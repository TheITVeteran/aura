"""Having a faculty and being able to use it are different facts.

Bryan: "A human is capable of searching too but likely won't get confused if
they try to use google with no internet. They would just know 'it won't
work.'... she should logically be able to infer 'Hey, I can't use web search
right now' and stick to that because she can logically separate tool
capability from the external factors needed to use that tool."

Aura had one axis. The registry knows which skills are registered and
enabled; nothing in it knows whether the world outside the process can
currently support them. A missing network therefore looked exactly like a
missing skill, so she would either claim a capability that could not possibly
work or deny one she has.

The second axis is preconditions, probed from the world. The verdict is
COMPOSED — capability AND preconditions — which is what makes it reasoning
rather than phrasing: unplug the network and the conclusion changes by
itself, with nothing anywhere mentioning networks.

The distinction these tests protect is the one a person makes without
effort: the faculty stays intact while the world is broken.
