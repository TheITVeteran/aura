"""Is this process running the code that is on disk?

`SourceBodyAwareness` watches the GIT DIRTY STATE, so committing an edit leaves
the tree clean while the running process stays exactly as stale. Nothing
measured the other quantity, so "are you running my latest fix?" had no
instrument behind it — and three separate defects on 2026-08-10 each cost a long
detour for want of it.
