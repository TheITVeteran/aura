"""The pointing half of companion mode had no wire in it.

``screen_highlight`` located an element and asked a ``desktop_overlay``
runtime service to draw a box around it. Nothing registered that service and
no surface ever forwarded the message, so ``get_runtime_service`` returned
None, ``_draw`` returned False, and every highlight in the live runtime came
back "overlay declined". The launcher's ``showHighlight`` — the code that
actually draws — was unreachable from the day it was written.

Nothing caught it because the tests exercised the parts: the locator was
tested, the refusals were tested, the rate limiter was tested by calling the
rate limiter. No test asked whether a rectangle could travel from a decision
in Python to a window on the screen.

These do. They drive the seam end to end — request, queue, poll, forward —
and they pin the two properties that make the seam honest rather than merely
present:

  * she must not claim to have pointed when nothing could draw. "I've
    highlighted it" over a screen with no highlight sends someone hunting for
    a box that was never there, which is worse than describing it in words;
  * a rectangle is collected exactly once and never after it has gone stale.
    A box around where something USED to be points at the wrong thing with
    full confidence.
