"""A verified answer must be reachable from every lane that composes a reply.

Live 2026-08-03: "show me a piece of your code you find interesting" was
answered "I couldn't get a clear enough answer together, and I'd rather say
that than hand you something thin" — while a real, correctly-cited, disk-read
excerpt sat one call away. The short phrasing answered correctly the whole
time, which made it look like a phrasing bug.

It was a lane boundary. The floors lived inside _direct_answer_floor on the
synthesis lane; that turn went to full cognition, whose draft the quality gate
filtered, and the last-resort composer apologised. Nothing on the cognition
lane could see them.

Saying "I have nothing" while holding something is the worst failure available
at that point, so this pins the shape rather than the one phrasing: the floors
are one shared function, and every lane consults it.
