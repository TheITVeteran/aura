"""Asked for her code, she showed code that exists in no file here.

LIVE DEFECT, 2026-08-03 19:43. Bryan asked "can you show me a section of your
code that you're interested in?", then "can you show me the actual code?", then
"show me a snippet of code from your actual codebase". Three times Aura
produced code — a generic tokenize/embed/transformer pipeline, and a
``reschedule_attention`` method — that appears nowhere in this repository. She
then said her implementation runs "across multiple GPUs and specialized
hardware accelerators"; told he has one GPU, she agreed and invented a second
explanation about dual-GPU laptops.

Nothing was read from disk. The conversational path could not reach the source
tree at all, so a question about her own code fell through to the weights,
which will always answer it with something that looks like code. The repo was
right there.
