"""Aura's private thoughts must not enter the conversation as her own turns.

LIVE DEFECT, 2026-07-25. A user said "Just checking in" and got back an
unprompted monologue about ghosts — "leftover bits from other people's
experiences" — followed by the model inventing "<dispatch a somatic probe>"
as if it were speech. The next user message was "Ghosts? what're you talking
about".

Nothing was hallucinated out of nowhere. personhood_engine._emit_thought
writes spontaneous thoughts into ``cognition.working_memory`` as
``role="assistant"`` with ``origin="spontaneous"``. The context assembler
filtered background material by origin, and its prefix list contained
``"spontaneous:"`` — with a colon. ``"spontaneous".startswith("spontaneous:")``
is False, so every spontaneous thought reached the conversational prompt as
one of Aura's own prior TURNS. The model read them as shared context and
continued that voice. ``somatic_noise`` and ``baseline_continuity``, both
global-workspace winners, arrived the same way.

One character of vocabulary drift between the writer and the filter.

The real lesson is that a hand-maintained string list silently diverged from
the code that writes those strings, and the symptom was incoherent speech
rather than a failing test. These tests pin both directions so the next
divergence fails here instead of in front of the user.
