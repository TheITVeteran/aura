"""When Aura can't answer, she must say so like a person, not a subsystem.

Bryan reported this from a real chat: small talk answered with
"I could not produce a reliable full-mind reply for that turn, so I failed
closed instead of sending an ungrounded answer." The 2026-07-25 endurance
probe served the same sentence on every retention turn.

"full-mind", "failed closed", "ungrounded", "output contract" are words for
the engineering log. To the person waiting they read as a machine describing
its own internals instead of talking to them — which is most of why a runtime
that is merely busy comes across as broken.

This is a ratchet over the user-visible failure strings in the chat route: a
new one written in engineering vocabulary fails here.
