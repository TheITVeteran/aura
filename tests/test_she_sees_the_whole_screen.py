"""A reading of the screen is a reading of the SCREEN, not of one window.

Live 2026-08-04 00:20. Chrome was open on half the display showing a YouTube
channel, Finder, Notes, TextEdit and System Settings were open behind, and
asked "can you tell me what you see on the screen right now?" Aura answered:

    Active app: aura-launcher
    Window: Aura Zenith (Completed 1/1 governed desktop steps.)

Objectively incomplete to the person looking at it, and she could see more.

Two causes.

The capture only took a screenshot — and therefore only ran OCR — when the
step's target string happened to contain "screenshot", "ocr", "visual",
"image" or "see". The planner emits read_screen_text with an EMPTY target, so
the ordinary path never captured, screen_text was always "", and the answer
fell back to the frontmost window's title. A capability that depends on
incidental wording is not a capability.

And capture() already collected the whole desk — every window, front to back,
with what covers what — into window_layout. The result builder dropped it.
That is also why "ignore your own window" and "what's behind you" could not be
answered: nothing downstream ever received anything but the frontmost title.
