"""A gate that cannot name a violation has not proven one.

LIVE, 2026-08-10. A turn died with this failure class:

    reply_reliability_gate_failed:

The separator, and nothing after it. assessment.reasons was empty, so the
reliability gate rejected a complete reply without naming a single violation,
the turn was recorded as exhausted, and the person got "I couldn't get to an
answer I'd stand behind on that one."

The runtime already refuses the mirror image of this — absence of a check must
never be reported as a passed check, which is written into five subsystems. The
same rule holds pointing the other way: absence of a finding must not be
reported as a failure. A reply in hand beats a canned refusal justified by
nothing.

The gate keeps every power it had. It simply has to say what is wrong.
