"""A forced-choice answer must land on the same option every time it commits.

LIVE, 2026-08-10. "Pick one: would you rather lose your memory of the last
month, or lose the ability to form new memories for the next month? Commit to
one and tell me why. No hedging."

    "Losing the ability to form new memories for the next month would be worse.
     ... losing them for a month would be catastrophic. ...
     To summarize: I prefer losing my ability to form new memories for one
     month, as it would be more inconvenient than losing a few weeks of memory."

She calls one option catastrophic and then commits to it. Not a wrong answer —
an unstable one, on the exact question shape where stability IS the content.

Mechanical to check: extract the option each commitment sentence lands on, and
require agreement. Rejecting one of two options selects the other, so "X would
be worse" and "I prefer Y" normalise to the same landing.
